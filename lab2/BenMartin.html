          <p>Many people I have talked to have different emotions about Ben. Some revere his, some hate him, some even want to be him but a general option I recieved was that everyone fears him. Ben was raised by a pack of wolves when he was abondoned at birth. He grew up with a pack of cubs which explains his animilistic nature, how he sometimes walks and all fours and has on occassion been seen howling at the moon naked. During the summer of 2006 he was found and brought back into society. He learn a variety of languages, Hebrew, Vulcan and English. A few years later he dicovered his love for golf. Maybe it was being outside with the wildlife or the fact he saw alot of older men but he thrived in this enviroment. All changed for Ben when he found a pound in a drain and decided to go to the local NisaLocal. He bought a lottery ticket and managed to win Â£125,000. He blew it all on heroin.</p>
