          <p>Ryan started his life as a humble farm boy who took pleasure in looking after his livestock. At the age of 11 he killed his first man. With an aspiration to become a Professional Gymnast he started to train more than 2 days a week to reach his goals. Disaster struck Ryan at the age 19 when he was trying to board the plane to the 2016 Rio Olympics when he fell through gangway connection, as it had not been properally connected to the plane, and broke his fibia. But Ryan was strong he still managed to pull off a perfect 1530 degree backflip and secure a bronze medal. Hurray!!! Currnetly Ryan has set his forever admiral sights on becoming the first man to do the moon walk on Mars. Good Luck Ryan <3. </p>
